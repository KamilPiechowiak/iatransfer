# Inter-Architecture Knowledge Transfer
iatransfer is a PyTorch package for transferring pretrained weights between models of different architectures instantaneously.

Drastically speed up your training process using two additional lines of code.

> [Documentation](https://kamilpiechowiak.github.io/iatransfer/iatransfer/toolkit/index.html)

## Installation
```bash
pip install iatransfer
```


## Usage
* simple
```python
import torch
from iatransfer.toolkit import IAT

transfer = IAT()

# run training on Model1()
model_from: nn.Module = Model1()

train(model_from)

# instantiate new model
model_to: nn.Module = Model2() 

# enjoy high-accuracy initialization
transfer(model_from, model_to)
```
* parametrization
```python
from iatransfer.toolkit import IAT


iat = IAT(standardization='blocks', matching='dp', score='autoencoder', transfer='trace')

# ==== or

iat = IAT(matching=('dp', {'param': 'value'}))

# ==== or

from iatransfer.toolkit.matching.dp_matching import DPMatching

iat = IAT(matching=DPMatching())
```
* plugins
```python
from iatransfer.toolkit.base_matching import Matching


class CustomMatching(Matching):

    def match(self, from_module, to_module, *args, **kwargs)
        # provide your implementation


# This will instantiate the above CustomMatching in IAT
iat = IAT(matching='custom') 
```

## Development

#### Init:
```bash
./dev/init.sh
```

#### Run tests:
```bash
nosetests tests
```
#### Install in edit mode:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Research reproduction:
Copy the source code to the GCP cloudshell or install `iatransfer_research` package.

Run:
```bash
/bin/bash ./scripts/research/iatransfer_full_run.sh
```
or
```bash
iatransfer_full_run.sh
```
if `iatransfer_research` has been installed.
