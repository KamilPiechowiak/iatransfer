# Inter-Architecture Knowledge Transfer
iatransfer is a PyTorch package for transferring pretrained weights between models of different architectures.

Drastically speed up your training process using two additional lines of code.


## Installation
```bash
pip install iatransfer
```


## Usage
```python
import torch
from iatransfer.toolkit import IAT

transfer = IAT()

# run training on Model1()
model_from: nn.Module = Model1()

train(model_from)

# instantiate new model
model_to: nn.Module = Model2() 

# enjoy high-accuracy initialization
transfer(model_from, model_to)
```
